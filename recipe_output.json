        "Prep. To make these cookies, you will start by preheating your oven and lining the baking sheets with parchment paper or silicon baking mats.",
        "Whisk dry ingredients. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking soda, and cornstarch until well combined. Make sure they are well blended so that when you add the dry ingredients to your butter mixture, they are well distributed throughout the cookie dough. Set aside.",
        "Mix wet ingredients. In a separate large bowl, using a stand mixer or hand mixer on medium speed, cream together the softened butter and the sugars until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary to make sure that the butter and sugar are well combined. Add the eggs and vanilla to the creamed butter and sugar mixture. By adding your vanilla extract at this point in the mixing process, the vanilla extract and the butter are combined more thoroughly, which then imparts more flavor to your baked cookies, in my opinion. Mix until well combined, about 1 minute.",
        "Add the dry to the wet. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and beat on a low speed until smooth and creamy. Be careful not to overmix here, as it will cause tough cookies.",
        "Stir in the chocolate chips. Add your chocolate chips (or chocolate chunks) and carefully stir into your batter using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. ( Note : I like to reserve a handful of chocolate chips to press into the top of the scooped cookie dough to make them even prettier!)",
        "Scoop and Bake. Scoop your cookie dough onto the baking sheet and bake for about 8 \u2013 10 minutes, until lightly golden brown. Sprinkle the cookies with a pinch of sea salt while they are still warm. Allow them to cool slightly on the baking sheet, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.",
        "Remove them from the oven and watch them disappear.",
