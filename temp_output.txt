Simple ingredients ‚Äì but something special that elevates them to the most amazing chocolate chip cookies every time!    The Best Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe  I‚Äôve made this chocolate chip cookie recipe for many years. It‚Äôs one of my baking recipes I have made so many times ‚Äì just like my Best Chocolate Cake recipe ‚Äì that I could make them from memory. And since I think everyone needs a great chocolate chip cookie recipe, I‚Äôm honored to share mine with you. I can‚Äôt wait for you to bake these easy, yet decadent and delicious chocolate chip cookies ‚Äì I know you are going to love them too!  While these are classic chocolate chip cookies , there is absolutely nothing ordinary about them! Very chocolatey with two kinds of chocolate chips, soft inside with a crisp outside, and extra decadent topped with a sprinkle or flake of sea salt for delicious cookies that everyone loves!  And there‚Äôs something so extra special about a warm, delicious chocolate chip cookie , right?!  Table of Contents The Best Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe How to Make Chocolate Chip Cookies Ingredients for the Best Chocolate Chip Cookies Tips to Bake the BEST Chocolate Chip Cookies Do You Need to Chill Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough for the Best Cookies? Steps for Making and Baking the Cookies How to Store Chocolate Chip Cookies How to Freeze Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Favorite Mix-Ins Leftover Makeover More Favorite Cookie Recipes Best Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe  How to Make Chocolate Chip Cookies  Here‚Äôs how you make them ‚Äì from the simple ingredients, each step you‚Äôll take, how to store and freeze them, and more tips to make them the best!  Ingredients for the Best Chocolate Chip Cookies  Butter  You can use either salted  or unsalted butter in this recipe, whichever you have. I generally keep salted butter and use that in my baking.  If you prefer to use unsalted butter, I do recommend that you include the optional sprinkle of salt on the top of the cookies. That sprinkle adds so much.  Make sure your butter is softened , as it will mix in the cookie dough much more easily and thoroughly. You do not want to use melted or butter that is too soft, as it will cause you to have flat cookies.  Resource: How to Soften Butter  Sugar  You use a combination of granulated white sugar and brown sugar in this cookie recipe. The brown sugar contains molasses, which adds a depth of flavor to the cookies and makes them even more delicious.  Eggs  You‚Äôll use standard large eggs in this recipe. I like to allow my eggs to reach room temperature for all of my baking, including cookies, but it isn‚Äôt as important for cookies as it is for baking cakes and cheesecakes. The room-temperature egg will cream together more easily and produce fluffier baked goods. Cold eggs from the refrigerator will still work in this recipe but will not cream together as easily.  Vanilla Extract  A good vanilla extract makes a huge difference in baking. You can either make your own from whole vanilla beans and liquor, or you can be sure to purchase the highest quality vanilla extract you can. There are a few brands at different price points that work well, such as Nielson-Massey, Rodelle, and McCormick Organic.  Resource: How to Make Vanilla Extract  Flour  This recipe uses all-purpose flour . Note that if you need to make these cookies gluten-free, I would recommend using Cup 4 Cup gluten-free flour blend in place of the all-purpose flour. It will slightly change the finished texture of the cookie but is delicious when you need to make sure that your cookies are gluten-free.  Salt  I use kosher salt in this recipe, specifically Diamond Crystal kosher salt brand, which has less sodium than some other brands. If you would like to use regular table salt, fine sea salt, or even another brand of kosher salt, I recommend that you  use half of the salt listed in the recipe.  For the topping, I also love to add a pinch of flaky sea salt to the tops of my cookies while they are still warm. üôÇ  Baking Soda  Baking soda is part of the leavening in these chewy chocolate chip cookies. Make sure that the baking soda is fresh.  Cornstarch  Cornstarch is used in baked goods to help ‚Äúsoften‚Äù the flour. This is one of the special ingredients I use. While I already use a soft winter wheat flour, adding cornstarch lightens the flour even more. It helps cookies have a softer, chewy texture. If you remember, cornstarch is added to all-purpose flour to make a quick, homemade cake flour substitute. While the ratios are different from those used in this cookie recipe, you can see the purpose of the cornstarch.¬†It also helps the cookies not to spread as much when baking.  Chocolate Chips  What is the best type of chocolate for chocolate chip cookies? The ones that you prefer! But I have found that using a blend of two types of premium baking chocolate does make for the best chocolate chip¬†cookie!  I love to use a blend of 1 cup each of Ghiradelli dark chocolate chips and semi-sweet chocolate chips . If you prefer sweeter chocolate, a blend of semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips is great.¬†I have found that using all milk chocolate can be a bit overwhelming.  If you want chocolate chunks in your cookie, I recommend using a blend of premium chocolate bars that you rough chop into chunks.    Tips to Bake the BEST Chocolate Chip Cookies   Make sure ingredients are fresh. Baking soda is the leavening agent and if it‚Äôs expired or not active, the cookies could fall flat.  Measure ingredients correctly. Be sure to use measuring cups designed for dry ingredients. Spoon and level to measure your flour.  Soften the butter, but don‚Äôt melt it. Softened butter combines better when creamed with the sugar.  Don‚Äôt overmix the dough. The cookies can fall flat if overmixed.  Don‚Äôt overbake the cookies. They will set more as they cool.    Do You Need to Chill Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough for the Best Cookies?  You don‚Äôt have to chill ‚Äì it is a matter of personal preference. And time.  Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve found.   Unchilled cookie dough will spread a little bit but will still be delicious.  Chilled cookie dough prevents the cookies from spreading as they bake. The butter becomes firm again within the cookie dough as the dough is chilled. Scoop the dough onto the baking sheet and refrigerate for about 20 ‚Äì 30 minutes. It helps prevent the cookies from spreading  too much and ensures you will not have flat cookies.   I make these cookies often enough that I generally like to keep scoops of the cookie dough at the ready in my freezer so I can bake a small batch of fresh chocolate chip cookies on a whim.  I also bake them frequently enough that I bake them immediately after mixing my cookie dough.  We love this cookie both ways. There is no wrong or right way to make them in my book! üôÇ   Steps for Making and Baking the Cookies  Prep. To make these cookies, you will start by preheating your oven and lining the baking sheets with parchment paper or silicon baking mats.  Whisk dry ingredients. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking soda, and cornstarch until well combined. Make sure they are well blended so that when you add the dry ingredients to your butter mixture, they are well distributed throughout the cookie dough. Set aside.  Mix wet ingredients. In a separate large bowl, using a stand mixer or hand mixer on medium speed, cream together the softened butter and the sugars until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary to make sure that the butter and sugar are well combined. Add the eggs and vanilla to the creamed butter and sugar mixture. By adding your vanilla extract at this point in the mixing process, the vanilla extract and the butter are combined more thoroughly, which then imparts more flavor to your baked cookies, in my opinion. Mix until well combined, about 1 minute.  Add the dry to the wet. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and beat on a low speed until smooth and creamy. Be careful not to overmix here, as it will cause tough cookies.  Stir in the chocolate chips. Add your chocolate chips (or chocolate chunks) and carefully stir into your batter using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. ( Note : I like to reserve a handful of chocolate chips to press into the top of the scooped cookie dough to make them even prettier!)  Scoop and Bake. Scoop your cookie dough onto the baking sheet and bake for about 8 ‚Äì 10 minutes, until lightly golden brown. Sprinkle the cookies with a pinch of sea salt while they are still warm. Allow them to cool slightly on the baking sheet, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.  Remove them from the oven and watch them disappear.  How to Store Chocolate Chip Cookies  Baked. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 3 days.  Unbaked. Store in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 3 months.  How to Freeze Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough   Place cookie dough balls onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and into the freezer until frozen, about 30 minutes. Then, remove the scoops from the baking sheet and place them into a freezer-safe, airtight container.  When ready to bake one, two, or ten cookies, pull that number out and bake. You may need to add a few more minutes to the baking time since they are being baked frozen.   Favorite Mix-Ins  Swap 1/2 cup of the chocolate chips with any of these add-ins for a fun addition.   Oats ‚Äì use 1/4 cup of quick-cooking oats  Pecans ‚Äì chopped, roasted pecans  Walnuts ‚Äì chopped, roasted walnuts  Toffee¬†Morsels  Butterscotch Chips  ‚Äã White Chocolate Chips  M&Ms ‚Äì you may want to swap a full cup! üòâ   Leftover Makeover  Who am I kidding? Leftover chocolate chip cookies? Haha‚Ä¶ But here are a couple of yummy ideas, just in case.  Ice Cream¬†Sandwiches ‚Äì completely cool your cookies and then fill them with a scoop of your favorite ice cream. I love to use my homemade vanilla ice cream . Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and freeze. Serve frozen.  Chocolate Chip Doozies ‚Äì a copycat of a favorite cookie store, scoop about 2 tablespoons of vanilla buttercream¬†onto the flat side of one cookie. Top with a second cookie for a frosting-filled treat!  Toasted Marshmallow Sandwiches ‚Äì rather than filling them with frosting, fill them with marshmallow fluff. Then, if you have a kitchen torch, carefully toast your marshmallow fluff until lightly brown. Top with the second cookie. Oh my!

Preheat oven to 350¬∫ F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. Whisk dry ingredients. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking soda, until well combined. Set aside. Mix wet ingredients. In a separate large bowl, using a stand mixer or hand mixer on medium speed, cream together the softened butter and the sugars until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary to make sure that the butter and sugar are well combined. Add the eggs and vanilla extract to the creamed butter and sugar mixture. Mix until well combined, about 1 minute. Mix wet and dry. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and beat on a low speed until smooth and creamy. Add the chocolate chips. Fold in the chocolate chips with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Chill. Cover the mixing bowl and chill the cookie dough for 20 minutes up to 4 days. Bake. Scoop the cookie dough onto the prepared¬†baking sheet with a large cookie scoop, spacing the cookie dough about 4 inches apart to allow room for the cookies to lightly spread as they bake. Bake for 12 ‚Äì 14 minutes, until the edges are slightly crispy, the cookie is overall lightly golden brown, and the center is set but not overcooked. Allow them to cool slightly on the baking sheet, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve and / or Store. Serve the cookies while they are warm and gooey or store for late enjoyment. To store, transfer them to an airtight container and store on the counter for 3 days or in the freezer (in a freezer-safe container) for up to 3 months. To thaw, remove from the freezer and allow to thaw on the counter.  Notes Chilling the dough. If the dough is chilled beyond an hour, remove it from the refrigerator as the oven preheats to allow the cookie dough to be scooped more easily.  Chocolate chips. Use your favorite type of chips. Milk will make the sweetest cookie, semi-sweet the medium sweetest, and dark chocolate will be the least sweet of the three. A combination of chocolate chips is delicious. I love to use a combination of semi-sweet and dark chocolate. You can also use chocolate chunks from two (1.45-ounce) chocolate bars.  Cornstarch. The cornstarch helps the baked cookie to be a soft and chewy bakery-style cookie. The cookie is still delicious without the cornstarch included.

My daughter and her middle school friends can‚Äôt ever get enough (so I lowered the sugar a bit!  ‚Äì getting the butter and sugar creamy and fluffy is important. ‚Äì chilling the dough properly is important!  We like making the dough into 1tbsp and 1/2tbsp sizes. 1tbsp is not too big, not too small‚Ä¶ 1/2 tbsp is perfect for our kids (ages 1-11yrs)  We also reduced the sugar successfully to roughly a heaping 3/4c of each sugar, instead of the full cup. We love freezing the dough or the cookies themselves‚Ä¶ the batch is perfect for a cookie jar, holiday gift, party favor, etc.  Dear Robyn Stone from AddAPinch, this is another one for the recipe books I‚Äôll be handing down to my children. Thank you!   Reply        Robyn Stone  says:    February 10, 2025 at 2:39 pm     Leslie, I always love to hear when families and their friends love one of my recipes. I‚Äôm thrilled that your daughter and her friends love these cookies. They have been a favorite of my son and his friends for years. Thanks for letting me know.           Nancy Chapin  says:    June 23, 2024 at 3:43 am     I am a chocolate chip cookie enthusiast, and I collect every recipe I can find on the internet. Then a make them one at a time for me and my family to taste test. We never seem to all agree which is the best. AND THEN‚Ä¶..I came to yours. OMG! Hands down, we all agreed we had to look no further! The perfect ingredients and the sea salt on top are exquisite!!! Thank you so much for sharing this truly amazing cookie!   Reply        Robyn Stone  says:    June 23, 2024 at 2:32 pm     Thanks so much, Nancy. I love that this chocolate chip cookie recipe is a favorite for all your family. That sea salt does make a difference, doesn‚Äôt it?         Debbie  says:    November 23, 2024 at 12:52 pm     I don‚Äôt see any reference to sea salt in the recipe or directions.  Where does the sea salt come in?         Robyn Stone  says:    November 25, 2024 at 2:56 pm     Debbie, I didn‚Äôt include the sea salt in the recipe but did mention in the post that you can add a sprinkle of sea salt to the top of the cookies or use flaked sea salt.
